# Monthly Fuel Usage Bar Chart Visualization

This project visualizes the monthly fuel usage data for petrol and diesel in a bar chart using the **amCharts** library. The chart displays fuel consumption across 12 months with interactivity and responsiveness.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the chart and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For integrating the amCharts library and processing the JSON data.
- **amCharts**: A charting library used to visualize the data.
- **http-server**: A simple, zero-configuration command-line HTTP server for testing locally.

## Project Features
- **Interactive Bar Chart**: Displays fuel usage per month, with separate bars for petrol and diesel.
- **Responsive Design**: The chart adjusts to fit different screen sizes, ensuring accessibility across devices.
- **Hover Tooltips**: Hover over each bar to see the precise fuel usage for petrol and diesel.
- **Data-driven**: The chart dynamically loads the fuel consumption data from a JSON object.

## Data Format
The data for monthly fuel usage is provided in a JSON object structured as follows:

```json
{
  "monthly_usage": [
    {
      "month": "January",
      "petrol_used_liters": 3,
      "diesel_used_liters": 5
    },
    ...
    {
      "month": "December",
      "petrol_used_liters": 4,
      "diesel_used_liters": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

Each month has two fields: `petrol_used_liters` and `diesel_used_liters`, representing the fuel consumption in liters for that particular month.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Then, install the necessary HTTP server globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/parthasarathy27/BarChart-Visualization-using-amCharts.git
cd BarChart-Visualization-using-amCharts
```

### 3. Run the Project Locally

Once you have the project set up, run the following command to start the HTTP server and view the project in your browser:

```bash
http-server
```

By default, the application will be accessible at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

## Usage

The project loads the JSON data and dynamically renders a bar chart with two bars (petrol and diesel usage) for each month. You can hover over the bars to see the exact usage details.

- **X-Axis**: Displays the months (January to December).
- **Y-Axis**: Represents the fuel usage in liters.
- **Bars**: Each month has two bars: one for petrol usage and one for diesel usage.

## Features and Interactivity
- **Tooltips**: Hovering over any bar will show a tooltip with the exact usage of petrol or diesel for that month.
- **Responsive Design**: The chart will automatically adjust its size based on the width of the screen, ensuring that it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Legend**: The chart includes a legend showing which color corresponds to petrol and which to diesel.

## Customization

The following customizations have been made to the chart:

- **Bar Colors**: Petrol bars are colored in a distinct color (e.g., light blue), while diesel bars are colored differently (e.g., green).
- **Chart Labels**: Labels for months and fuel types are visible and readable.
- **Tooltip Configuration**: Each tooltip displays the exact liters consumed for both petrol and diesel when hovering over the bars.
